	<h4>My Hobbies Include...</h4>
	<p>Fishing, Boxing, and anything involved with the outdoors.  I spend a lot of time making videos, editing, and working on production projects for my major.  I enjoy doing sports broadasting and working with the production team on campus to live stream our athletic games. I also enjoy watching and analyzing films.  I love any form of creating. I have wanted to be a Film/TV major ever since the 6th grade when I got my first computer and started playing with Imovie. </p>
